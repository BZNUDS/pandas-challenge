Pandas Homework - Pandas, Pandas, Pandas

Background
The data dive continues!
Now, it's time to take what I've learned about Python Pandas and apply it to new situations. For this assignment, I decided to completed the Heroes Of Pymoli data and analytical analysys. 

I created a new repository for this project called pandas-challenge:  https://github.com/BZNUDS/pandas-challenge.

I then cloned the new repository to my computer.

Inside my local git repository, I created a directory for the Pandas Challenge HeroesOfPymoli. 

Add your Jupyter notebook to this folder. This will be the main script to run for analysis.

I pushed the above changes to GitHub.


 Heroes of Pymoli

I have been assigned the task of analyzing the data for the most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.
My final report HeroesOfPymoli.ipynb includes each of the following:

Player Count

Total Number of Players


Purchasing Analysis (Total)

Number of Unique Items
Average Purchase Price
Total Number of Purchases
Total Revenue


Gender Demographics

Percentage and Count of Male Players
Percentage and Count of Female Players
Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed


Purchasing Analysis (Gender)

The below each broken by gender

Purchase Count
Average Purchase Price
Total Purchase Value
Average Purchase Total per Person by Gender




Age Demographics

The below each broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. <10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.)

Purchase Count
Average Purchase Price
Total Purchase Value
Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group




Purchasing Analysis (age)

The below each broken into bins of 4 years (i.e. <10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.)

Identify the the top 5 spenders in the game by total purchase value, then list (in a table):

As final considerations:

I used the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
My written description of three observable trends based on the data is called Analysis for Pandas House of Pymoli  Zdarsky  Final v1 and can be found at https://github.com/BZNUDS/pandas-challenge/tree/main/HeroesOfPymoli
